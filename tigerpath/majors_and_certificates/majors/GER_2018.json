These elements can be profitably linked with departmental courses. Students will consult with the departmental representative under whose guidance they will develop their own program. During the first term of the junior year, students are required to take the Junior Seminar GER 300 which serves as an intensive workshop of research and writing skills, an introduction to a wide range of approaches and methods, and an incubator for the Spring Term Junior Paper, an essay of approximately 4,000 words on a subject in German philosophy, art, media, linguistics, literature, or politics. This essay, as well as the senior thesis, may be written in German or English. Early in May of the junior year students should discuss plans for their senior theses with the departmental representative.",

By the end of the fourth week of the first senior term students will submit to their advisers a tentative outline of the proposed thesis. Further progress reports (as announced by the department) are required. Five weeks before the departmental examination students must deliver to their advisor and to the departmental representative a copy of the thesis (signed and in PDF format). The title page must show the student's name and class numerals, the department in which the student is enrolled, the name of the adviser, and the month and year of presentation. First and second readers will return written reports to students in advance of the departmental exam. After the departmental exam and upon approval of the thesis, students must submit one electronic copy of the thesis (PDF format) for the department archive. Students will receive a message from the Dean of the College during the spring term concerning the electronic submission of the senior thesis to the library.",
