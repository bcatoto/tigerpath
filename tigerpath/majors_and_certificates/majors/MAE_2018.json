      "explanation": "Senior Independent Work is the culminating experience for the mechanical and aerospace engineering programs. All seniors are required to participate in a research or engineering project. All projects must include elements of engineering design (engineering design is the process of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs). The following courses satisfy this requirement: MAE 439 Senior Independent Work (one semester, fall); MAE 440 Senior Independent Work (one semester, spring); MAE 442 Senior Thesis (yearlong); MAE 444 Senior Project (year-long). Students are strongly encouraged to select the year-long project or thesis option. Senior projects are intended for teams or groups while senior thesis is intended for individuals. For senior project or thesis, work begins in the fall but enrollment is only in spring term when a double grade is awarded. Please note: If a student has selected to participate in a year-long project or thesis and is enrolled in only three courses during the fall semester, it is required that they will enroll in Senior Project or Thesis during the spring semester. For these students, it will NOT be possible to drop-down to a one-semester course of Independent Work without incurring a failure for Independent Work in the fall term. In Spring term you must enroll in three courses plus senior thesis or senior project (senior thesis and senior project count as two courses). Therefore your senior year course load will be 3 in fall and 5 in spring as opposed to 4 in fall and 4 in spring. There are NO exceptions to this rule even if your total number of courses will exceed 36.",
