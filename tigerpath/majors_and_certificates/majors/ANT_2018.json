Normally, field research is not appropriate for this paper. In the fall, students develop a detailed problem statement and annotated bibliography on a subject relevant to the student's interests, as a research proposal for approval by the department. In the spring, students write a paper based on the research initiated in the fall, in consultation with their adviser. Since the junior paper topic is chosen before the deadline for declaring a track, junior papers, unlike senior theses, do not have to be related to a studentâs chosen track. Junior independent work, regardless of track, is meant to teach students how to do a review of the anthropological literatures related to a studentâs area of interest.",
