  "explanation": "The Princeton Neuroscience Institute offers the neuroscience concentration for undergraduates with a strong interest in pursuing an in-depth study of the brain. Neuroscience is a broad interdisciplinary field requiring rigorous preparation in basic science. Students in this discipline are expected to understand the basic principles and approaches of modern neuroscience. The concentration provides an opportunity for the serious study of molecular, cellular, developmental, and systems neuroscience as it interfaces with cognitive and behavioral research. Since modern neuroscience is relying increasingly on quantitatively sophisticated methods and theory, students are also expected to gain competency in, physics, mathematics and computation. By offering a combination of courses and interdisciplinary research, students who complete the neuroscience concentration will be highly qualified to pursue graduate work at the best neuroscience, psychology or biology graduate programs and will also have completed, in large part, the background requirements to enter medical or veterinary school. Other possible career paths for those with a neuroscience degree can be found here.",

The tutorial is broken into two 4-week sections, each with a distinct topic area. At the end of each section, you will be asked to write a short critique of a relevant research paper assigned by the instructor. Students will attend and participate in a total of 8 discussion groups and will write 2 short papers for the fall tutorial.\n\nOne major product: Students’ Spring Independent Work culminates with the submission of a research proposal. This proposal will serve as the basis for your senior thesis work. As is typical of research proposals, the document will include a short survey of the literature.\n\nYou should expect to meet with your advisor ~5 times during the semester to formulate the project and discuss the literature.",
