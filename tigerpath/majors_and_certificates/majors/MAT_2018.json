Prospective mathematics majors should consult the department early and plan a program that includes as much of the 215-217 or 216-218 sequence as possible. Most majors begin taking courses at the 300-level by the second semester of the sophomore year, in preparation for their junior independent work.\n\nSome of our successful majors became interested in mathematics as a major after taking 103 or 104. Such students should consult with the Junior Advisor or the Associate Departmental Representative as soon as possible.",
